" ==========================
" Notes on Eclipse + Vrapper
" ==========================
"
" Shortcut/Command behaviours:
"   :bd or :q     close current tab
"   :ls           list tabs (only in current split window)
"   :tabs         list all open tabs (like :ls in vim)
"                 (but :ls in eclipse better for tab switching)
"   alt + <-/->   Navigate between modifiations
"   ctrl + F6     cycle through tabs
" Changes to eclipse shortcuts:
"   unbind Ctrl+W (Close)
"   unbind Ctrl+K (Find Next)
"   unbind Ctrl+L (Go to Line)
" Misc notes:
"   Indentation commands (<<,>>) do not respect Eclipse's settings for
"     indentation!
"   Only editor tabs instead of buffers -> switch via :ls
"   No leader key (has to be hardcoded)
" Configurations I do in Eclipse instead of this file:
"   Color-Theme (Color Theme Plugin!)
"     favourite: Molokai Port
"   Code-Style (Tabs, Spaces, etc.)
"     -> Formatter Profile
"   Whitespace characters:
"     don't show linebreaks/linefeeds
"     show only trailing spaces
"   Show print margin at 80 characters

" =============

noremap <c-w>ö <c-w>l
noremap <c-w>l <c-w>k
noremap <c-w>k <c-w>j
noremap <c-w>j <c-w>h

" <leader>b => list tabs
nnoremap ,b :ls<CR>

" TODO Switch to "alternate file" (i.e. last tab)
"nnoremap ,, :b#<CR>

" Go to declaration (needs JDT/CDT/PyDev)
" TODO mapping does not work as expected...
nnoremap ,d <c+]>

" Autoformat
nnoremap ,f :format

" Maximize editors (toggle)
